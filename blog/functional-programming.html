    <h1>What is Functional Programming?</h1>
    <h4>January 31, 2016</h4>
    <p>In a way, functional programming is really just math. The first computer, the Turing Machine uses the same principals of computation as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">lambda calclus</a>. Lamba calculus's most basic principals are variable binding, and subsitutuion., which you find in many programming languages.</p>
    <p>Functional programming has two main principals. The first is that the data should be immutable. Usually in programming, this doesn't make sense because you want something that can be reapplied. In reality, if you need to use different data, just make a new instance of data. Secondly, the program should be stateless. This means that the program should have no knowledge of what happened in the past, and perform every task as if it were for the first time.</p>
    <p>Using these two principals, the main idea here is to create simple repeatable actions that can be formed as a function. In order for the process to work, all functions must take at least one argument. All functions must also return either data, or another funtion. Lastly, you cannot use loops.</p>
    <p>The benefits of function programming are simple. It is easier to read and understand. Because of the simpler logic, it will take you far less time to create, and be much easier to debug. The JavaScrit libraries Bacon.js as well as Underscore.js are based on function programming and are becoming more widespread.</p>
