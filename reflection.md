##What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I reinforced my understanding of the box model. I feel like I still don't get it 100%, and I know my CSS is sloppy, but I got it to work. Margin is outside of the element, padding is space that makes the obejct larger, and borders are the edge of the element.

##What did you learn about CSS positioning?

I used floats and display properties to configure my blog.

##What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

The easisest was definitely text and link styling. The hardest was the footer. I ended up jerryrigging my code with a workaround in order to get the footer to appear on the bottom of all my pages, and there are some flaws to it.

##What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I purposely tried to target elements without using classes and IDs. In the future, I think I would use them more heavily. Classes and IDs are easy to target and change, where you can have many more mistakes with less specificity.
