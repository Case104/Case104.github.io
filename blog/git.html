    <h1>An Introduction to Git and Github</h1>
    <h4>December 6, 2015</h4>
    <h3>Git and Github, understanding the difference</h3>
    <p>Git and GitHub are both tools used to store and share your work, as well as collaborate and work as a team. After learning that JavaScript and Java have nothing in common, I approached Git and Github as seperate entities at first, but quickly learned that they do work together to provide effective data sharing and version control.</p>
    <p>Git is a tool for version control. Git lives locally on your computer, and stores data like a snapshot. This snapshot is stored as a commit, which is a saved change that is coupled with documentation in the form of an attached comment. Each commit that you make acts as a savepoint that you can return to. Files reside in three states, commited, modified, and staged. When a file is in the modified stage, it means that changes have been made since the last iteration, but that those changes have nnot been saved. In the staged phase, the changes have been added to the queue to be saved, but have not been stored yet. Finally, the committed stage is where the changes are saved, and a comment is added to provide context. <br>For a more compete understanding of the phases of files in Git, check out <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics">this link</a>.</p>
    <p>Github on the other hand was created to allow sharing of information, and storage remotely, outside of your computer. It is similar to Git by how it stores and shares information using the same snapshot model. I think the biggest benefit of GitHub is that many people can be working in seperate branches that have no effect on the source code while they are working. Once they are done, it goes through a sort of peer review called a pull request. This is great because it allows developers to work side by side in a stable environment, while contributing work as well as checking over each other's code.</p>
    <h3>Saving your work and pushing it to GitHub, the Workflow</h3>
    <p>First I will write the workflow that I use to push my work to GitHub from Git, and then I will explain how the process works.<br><br>1.  Check your status, current branch, and run a pull before doing anything. This makes sure that you are going into your new work clean. Do this by typing "git status", "git branch", and "git pull".<br>2. Create a new branch. "git checkout -b branch-name".<br>3. Create your code.<br>4. Add your work to be committed. "git add work.extension".<br>5. Commit your work. "git commit -m "your comment here".<br>6. Push your work to GitHub. Log in if necessary. "git push origin branch-name".<br>7. Complete your pull request on GitHub.<br>8. Move back to your master branch. "git checkout master".<br>9. Pull the information back to your computer. "git pull"<br>10. Delete your pulled branches. "git branch -d branch-name".</p>
    <h3>Explanation and Closing Thoughts</h3>
    <p>In the first step, you are making sure that your work space is clean by verifying that you have the most current code from the repository, no pending changes, or renegade branches. After that, you are creating a new branch to work off of. Working in a feature branch allows you to make changes without worrying about mucking up your current code. Once you make your changes, you are moving your changes from the modified phase into the staged phase. Then when your changes are aded, you move to the committed phase and add documentation of the changes. Best practice is to use present tense, 50 characters or less, and begin with a capital letter.</p>
    <p>Here we are pushing our changes from the feature branch, to the origin, GitHub. Ideally a collaborator will approve your pull request. This pull request is basically a verification phase before editiing the origin. At this point, changes have been made to your feature branch, and to your origin on GitHub. Now you want to return to your terminal, switch to your master branch, and pull the changes down to update your master branch. You can also use the command "git fetch origin master" followed by merging them with "git merge origin/master". Finally clean your work space by deleting redundant branches.</p>
