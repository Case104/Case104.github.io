            <h3>Note to the poor DBCer reading this: I just started writing....and you see the result. I plan on changing all of this next week!</h3>
            <p>Hello, my name is Jonathan. I am from Flemington, a small town in New Jersey that is nothing like the stereotypes. I've always been a perfectionist, and compettive by nature. Combined with the fact that I'm a hobbyist, that means that I often throw myself at whatever my current interst is and learn everything I can about it. In the past I've focused on Magic The Gathering, Dungeons and Dragons, League of Legends, Counter Strike, basketball, the San Antonio Spurs, and most recently, coding.</p>
            <p>When I started college in Florida, I wanted to be a psychology teacher or psychologist. I worked in sales during the day, and went to class at night. I was a telemarketer, selling vacations to Mexico over the phone. As I learned more, I moved on to work for Hilton. There, my job was to be the guy that talks to you when you say "no", and turn it into a sale. I had a knack for it and was quickly offered a promotion to team leader, but it would mean giving up my schooling. I decided to take it. The promotion was worth more than I would probably be making out of school, and I didn't like the idea of five more years of schooling and loans.</p>
            <p>After a little while I decided that I wanted to move back home, and try my hand at in-person sales. I moved back to New Jersey with my then girl-friend in tow, and took a job with Yellowbook. I had a knack for web design in high school, and here was my first brush with it in the real world. I sold Search Engine Marketing(SEM) and Search Enginge Optimization(SEO) to small businesses. I loved the subject matter, but I was not a fan of the amount of driving. I would be in a car for about six hours every day, commuting to my territory and driving from appointment to appointment. I met an investor in the startup industry, and we came up with a plan</p>
            <p>The idea was an online platform for players of a popular video game, League of Legends, to network in order to form teams. The platform would offer networking, training, team management resources, and paid tournaments. The important part of this was that I gained a mentor and investor who set me up as a product manager and taught me how to manage the building of software as part of an agile team. I worked remotely for a while, while our small team of devs worked on a MVP. It was at this point that we realized we would need to have some sort of PR backing to get a base of users to make our product valuable. I moved out to Salt Lake City, and we funded a competitive esports team.</p>
            <p>Frankly, the esports team failed. I learned a ton, and moved back home. After looking for a little while, I settled into a "temporary" job as a car salesman. In a year I was promoted to an Internet Sales Manager, my job being to manage all the incoming leads into the delaer, the website, and our marketing strategy. This is also when I realized that I want to be a computer engineer. I'd always dabbled with it but wrote it off as something that I didn't have time to go to school for. At this point my then girlfriend became a fiance, and I felt like taking loans would be irresponsible. I started to self teach myself.</p>
            <p>The going was slow.... really slow. Car sales is a ton of hours, and I had little direction of what to learn and how. After about a year and a half of reading a ton of books and tutorials, but creating almost nothing on my own, I decided to look for another method. I learned about coding schools. Everyone seems to love them or hate them, but the one thing I noticed is that the haters.... never went. I saw it as an opportunity to get guidance in my learning while meeting the criteria of not taking years of schooling and putting my family (now wife) into financial hardship. I decided on Dev Bootcamp because they had the longest track record for success, and their reviews were outstanding. I'm six weeks in, and so far I'm not regretting it. I've already created more in this time than I had in the year and a half previous, and I'm not even on site yet. And better yet, I can't wait to write the next paragraph.</p>
