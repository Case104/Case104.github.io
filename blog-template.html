How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

It was nice to be able to bounce ideas off of each other and see how our origional thoughts were different.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

I do like havng a roadmap to have an idea of where I am heading. I have now done one online using a wireframing program, and one in paper. I like the feel of doing it on paper more, but it is easier to share and iterate over an online copy.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 

We decided that a wireframe should be clear, simple, and vague. We agreed that a wireframe should serve as a rough sketch for layout and have the space for creativity and additions as you go.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

I used head,er nav, main, and footer. These were all new to Jeremy, and this is only my second time using thm.
